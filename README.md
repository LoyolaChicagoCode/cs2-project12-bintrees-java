# Loyola COMP 271 Project 12: binary tree explorations

## Group activity

In this activity, you'll explore binary trees built from interlinked nodes.

# Objectives

An understanding of the following concepts and techniques:

- ADT implementation perspective
- dynamically allocated objects
- binary trees
- nonlinear linked structures
- navigating through binary trees
- iterators
  
# Instructions

In this lab, you will have the opportunity to look "under the hood" of linked lists by creating and manipulating nodes.
You can do this interactively using the JShell that comes with your Java installation, or you can define a full-fledged IntelliJ IDEA Java project.

1. Start the JShell like so:

       jshell -R-ea

   If this does not work, double-check your Java installation.

1. Define this generic binary tree node class:

       class BTNode<E> {
         public E data;
         public BTNode<E> left;
         public BTNode<E> right;
         
         public BTNode(final E data, final BTNode<E> left, final BTNode<E> right) { 
           if (data == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException("data is null");
           this.data = data; 
           this.left = left;
           this.right = right;
         }
         public BTNode(final E data) { this(data, null, null); }
         
         @Override public String toString() { 
           final StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
           result.append("BTNode@");
           result.append(hashCode());
           result.append("(");
           result.append(data);
           result.append(", ");
           result.append(left != null ? "BTNode@" + left.hashCode() : ".");
           result.append(", ");
           result.append(right != null ? "BTNode@" + right.hashCode() : ".");
           result.append(")");
           return result.toString();
         }
       }
       
   Hint: If you make a mistake in a class or method definition, don't worry. 
   You can just reenter it to replace the erroneous or incomplete definition.
   
1. *Question:* In the `toString` method, why are we using `StringBuilder` instead of the `+` operator?

1. Create an empty binary tree, represented as null:

       BTNode<Integer> empty = null

1. Create a leaf:

       BTNode<Integer> leaf = new BTNode<>(9)

1. Create the following binary tree. Use as many statements as you want to build up the tree successively.

             1
           /   \
         2       3
        / \     / \
       4   5   6   7
              /
             8

1. Now create the same tree using a single statement involving nested constructor invocations.

1. *Question:* Which way to create the tree more clearly conveys the actual structure of the tree?

1. Define a method for counting the number of nodes in a binary tree. (For an empty tree, the result is 0.)

       <E> int size(final BTNode<E> root) { ... }

   *Hint:* To define this and any of the following methods, use recursion as you see fit.

   *Be sure to handle special cases correctly, such as empty trees and leaves.*

1. Given a binary tree, compute its *height*, i.e., the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node. The height of the empty tree is 0, the height of a leaf is 1, and the height of the tree defined above is 4.

       <E> int height(final BTNode<E> root) { ... }

1. Define a method for printing the data values in a tree in the following order ("inorder"): 

       <E> void printTree(final BTNode<E> root) { ... }  

   1. print the nodes in the left subtree
   
   1. print the root node
   
   1. print the nodes in the right subtree

   For example, for the tree above, your method should print `4 2 5 1 8 6 3 7`.

1. Now define a method for printing the data values in a tree in the following order ("postorder"):

       <E> void printTreePostorder(final BTNode<E> root) { ... }

   1. print the nodes in the left subtree
   
   1. print the nodes in the right subtree

   1. print the root node
   
   For example, for the tree above, your method should print `4 5 2 8 6 7 3 1`.
  
1. Finally, define a method for replacing a tree in-place with its mirror image. 
   To achieve this, swap the roles of the left and right child references at every node.

       <E> void mirror(final BTNode<E> root) { ... }

   For example, the tree

           4 
          / \ 
         2   5 
        / \ 
       1   3

   becomes
 
          4 
         / \ 
        5   2 
           / \ 
          3   1

1. *Question:* Are any of these methods tail-recursive?

1. *Question:* Could we use a stack instead of explicit recursion to implement these methods?

1. *Question:* Conceptually speaking, how would you implement an iterator for a tree, which would provide `hasNext` and `next` methods to produce the data values in the trees one after the other in, say, inorder?
